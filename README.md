# FireScape
FireScape is a computer vision application that identifies wildfire hazards in residential areas using high-resolution satellite images.

### How it works
FireScape was made using Google Earth satellite images and residential data from the city of Los Angeles. The app ingests an address and performs a fuzzy match to a dataframe containing parcel and structure information for LA county. The app finds a high-resolution georeferenced satellite image centered on the property and uses a YOLOv3 CNN and unsupervised pixel classification (k-means clustering) to identify potential wildfire hazards. Currently the model detects three hazards: (1) trees that overhang structures; (2) trees that overhang property boundaries; (3) trees that are too close together. 

scratch.py runs a streamlit application
hazardMap.py contains methods to analyze images and identify hazards
generateimages.py contains methods to create georectified images and ingest coordinates for parcel boundaries and structures
create_master_tables.ipynb was used to parse the LA databases

### Data sources
Google Earth images were downloaded with SAS Planet
LA data parcel data: https://geohub.lacity.org/datasets/6d85cb5f5f5641c6aa95203849ca05bb_0
Training data were generated by hand from Google Earth images using labelimg and are included in the data folder (tree bounding boxes)
